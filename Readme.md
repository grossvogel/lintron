## Setup

```
bundle install
```

Lintron uses a GitHub machine user to make the comments. You just set up a separate user for it and set up a new developer application for that user. Then, you will need a .env file containing to the following keys:

```
GITHUB_USERNAME=…from the github user
GITHUB_TOKEN=…from the github user
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=…make up a secret shared between lintron and github
GITHUB_APP_ID=…the developer application's id
GITHUB_APP_SECRET=…the developer application's secret
```

## Linter Configuration

To override linter settings, use the configuration file for the linter. For global settings (across all projects), override the files at the root of the Lintron application. For project specific settings, Lintron will respect configurations placed at the root of your repo.

## Setting Up Webhooks

Lintron uses webhooks to know when a PR has been created or updated. You'll need to set up the webhook on each repo you want Lintron to monitor.

Log into your Lintron instance with your GitHub credentials. You will be taken to a page (`/hooks`) where you can attach Lintron's required hooks to a repo.

Alternatively, you can set up the webhooks manually:

![Webhooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prehnRA/lintron/master/960px-Webhook3.png)

The webhook url will be https://yourlintronhost/github_webhooks. The secret will be the one you set in your .env file. Lintron needs to be on a publicly reachable host to receive webhooks.


## Local CLI

`gem install lintron`

You must create a `.linty_rc` file like:

```
{
  "base_branch": "origin/master",
  "base_url": "URL_OF_YOUR_LINTRON"
}
```

Then you can run `lintron` or `lintron --watch`
